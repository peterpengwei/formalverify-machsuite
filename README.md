# formalverify-machsuite

This repo contains a set of HLS C functions and their corresponding verilog implementations generated by Xilinx SDAccel.

The initial version contains two instances of the same computation kernel: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

We obtain the original code from MachSuite, and modify it to be HLS synthesizable (also compilable via GNU GCC).
